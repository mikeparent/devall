							Devall &amp; Son is the product of three generations of the Devall family, working to serve the bereaved in their local community. 
						</h3>
						<div class="indent-tablet">
							<p>
								It all began with Maurice Devall—our inspiration. At 15, he joined the funeral profession, carpentering coffins for the local community in Crewe, Cheshire. In his time, he earned a wonderful reputation for serving the bereaved within the local community—a reputation we strive to uphold still. He rose through the ranks of the funeral business, but he never lost sight of what was most important: to be a helping hand at a most fragile time.
							</p>
							<p>
								We lost Maurice suddenly in 1969, and since then, one-by-one, our family has followed in his footsteps and joined the industry. But it was in 1986 that our founders David and Stephanie Devall established business, and thus Devall &amp; Son was born. 
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								Devall &amp; Son was established in Maurice’s honour and as the generations of our family — blood or not — has grown, so has our business.

							At 18, David (following in his father’s footsteps) began his career with Co-Operative Funeralcare, in Nuneaton. He rose through the company ranks—earning his qualifications in both funeral directing and embalming along the way—and by the age of 26 he had been promoted to Regional Operations Manager in the Bristol and Bath area. But he still felt he could do more, so, along with Stephanie, they established Devall &amp; Son. Although David and Stephanie have since gone their separate ways in their personal lives, they both still have a pivotal role in the business.

								Stephanie began her career in the funeral profession when she left school in 1980. She worked for the Bristol/Bath Co-Operative funeral service as a receptionist, and in less than a year, she progressed to the role of funeral arranger. At 17 she started her British Institute of Embalmers qualification, where she met David. She continued to climb the industry ladder, gaining her Diploma in Funeral Directing along the way, until 1986 where she and David came back to Nuneaton to start the family business.

							<blockquote class="invert">
								Stephanie was recently invited to serve as an examiner for the National Association of Funeral Directors (NAFD) in 2011—a huge achievement, especially for an independent director.
